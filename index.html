                        <h2> Importance of Personal Health and Wellbeing</h2>

                        <p>Mental and emotional health, physical health and a healthy lifestyle all contribute to an individual’s health and wellbeing. The following section includes definitions of each of these facets of health, why they matter and things to consider. Health and wellbeing issues will change with time, not only because of pandemics or the economic environment but also as the societal concept of health and wellbeing changes. The last few years has seen post-traumatic stress disorder, financial stress and the wellbeing impact of menopause become more relevant and visible in the workplace. Our evaluation of health and wellbeing needs to bear this ever-changing landscape in mind.

                        <p>Another way to think about mental health is like thinking about the weather. As the seasons change, the weather does too. There are bright and sunny days which make us feel happy and want to do things like going outdoors, but on other days the weather can change to darker, rainy days, where you don’t feel like leaving the house. Like the weather, your mental health can go through periods of positive and bright bursts of energy, and it can also dip and drag you down a darker road. You may feel tired and lack motivation or energy to do the simple things, such as getting out of bed or getting on with your day. Whatever you are feeling, know that this is completely normal, and you can seek support or speak to family and friends about how you are feeling. Many people are reluctant to talk about their feelings and their mental health – there is still a stigma around it. Ironically, not sharing our feelings with anyone, or even knowing what they are, can make our mental health worse. Talking can help us find hope again, and feel closer to other people.

                        <h2> Work-life Balance</h2>

                        <p>Grind culture, the deeply held belief that work is the most important thing in the world, has been embedded in collective psyches. We ask children what they want to be when they grow up, normalise working outside of working hours and consume self-made billionaire narratives in the hopes that we can labour our way into wealth. Nevertheless, until some drastic political changes are made, most of us need jobs to survive. </p>
                        
                    <p>A boundary is a rule you set for yourself and the commitment not to break it. If you’ve ever spent time in the self-improvement corner of Instagram, you’ll get a lot of jargon like “cut people out who don’t respect your boundaries” and “know your worth” with few real insights on what that means. Boundaries are about your behaviour, rather than anyone else’s. It’s about what you decide is ok with you and acting accordingly. It’s not even strictly necessary to state them to other people, although this can be useful in your relationships. For example, say you state a boundary that you don’t want to work more than you’re paid for. It then becomes up to you to keep that boundary, not for the sake of others, but for your own peace of mind. </p>
                    
                    <p>Employers expect more from their people, which leads to them feeling more pressure to achieve greater results. These pressures appear to have reached a breaking point, as people realise that they need to achieve better balance in their lives. As a business leader, you have a responsibility to help all your team juggle the demands of their work and personal lives. Even your most engaged employees may still be struggling to find balance</p>
                  
                    <p>Maintaining a healthy work-life balance is not only important for health and relationships, but it can also improve your employee’s productivity, and ultimately performance. Put simply, if your people don’t view work as a chore, then they will work harder, make fewer mistakes and are more likely to become advocates for your brand.</p>

                        <p>People are less active nowadays, partly because technology has made our lives easier. We drive cars or take public transport. Machines wash our clothes. We entertain ourselves in front of a TV or computer screen.Fewer people are doing manual work, and most of us have jobs that involve little physical effort. Work, household chores, shopping and other necessary activities are far less demanding than for previous generations. We move around less and burn off less energy than people used to. Research suggests that many adults spend more than 7 hours a day sitting down, at work, on transport or in their leisure time. People aged over 65 spend 10 hours or more each day sitting or lying down, making them the most sedentary age group.</p>
                        <p>Whatever your age, there's strong scientific evidence that being physically active can help you lead a healthier and happier life. Exercise can reduce your risk of major illnesses, such as coronary heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes and cancer, and lower your risk of early death by up to 30%. When it comes to exercise and fitness for seniors, most can begin without consulting a doctor—but there are exceptions. If you have a major health condition like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart or lung disease, osteoprosis or a neurological disease, definitely talk to your doctor first. People with mobility issues such as poor balance or arthritis should also get advice from their doctor.</p>
